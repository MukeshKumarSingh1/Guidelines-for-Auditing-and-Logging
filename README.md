Guidelines for Auditing and Logging
	

It was around 2005, and while SIEM and Log Management systems were evolving, dealing with cyber security incidents in an enterprise environment was a tough job. And especially if we talk about orthodox government departments.

While dealing with various Cyber Security incidents and providing support to various sizes and types of organizations, I came across an idea to have a standard document for logging and auditing systems and applications and this project came into picture. I did my best and handed over the paper before leaving the organization in March 2007, and later on, refined it further by my brilliant ex-colleagues and published it as “Guidelines for Auditing and Logging” in December 2008.
